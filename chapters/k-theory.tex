\section{vec-bun-review}{7088ed}{Vector Bundles}

Before we can begin to tackle $K$-Theory, we will recall some basic facts
of vector bundles, though we will probably gloss over most of the details.
Throughout, we fix some nice field such as $\R$ or $\C$ (though, in general,
we assume to be working over $\C$ unless otherwise noted) and henceforth
supress it from the notation.

\begin{defn}{vec-buns}{d755ef}
  A \emph{vector bundle} $\xi$ consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A surjection of spaces $p: E \srj B$. We call $p$, $E$, and $B$ the
          projection, total space, and base space, respectively.
    \item For each $b\in B$, a finite-dimentisonal vector space structure 
          on each fiber $p^{-1}\Par{b}$, which make each fiber into a 
          topological vector space.
  \end{itemize}  
  Furthermore, the map $p$ is \emph{locally trivial}, that is, for each 
  $b\in B$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ around it such that $p^{-1}\Par{U}$
  is homeomorphic to $B \times V$ for some vector space $V$.
\end{defn}

Since the dimension of each fiber varies continuously along $B$, it is clear that when $B$
is connected, all of the fibers have the same dimension. We call this number the \emph{rank}
of the bundle. We may refer to a rank $1$ bundle as a \emph{line bundle}, and to a rank $n$
bundle as an \emph{$n$-plane bundle}. 

The trivialization requirement suggests a simple class of vector bundles: those which
are \emph{globally trivial}:
\begin{exmp}{trivial-vec-bun}{47b41a}
  Given a space $X$ and a vector space $V$, we may form the \emph{trivial bundle}
  \[ \pr[1]: X \times V \to X \]
  whose projection being the product projection (hence the name!) and whose fiber is $V$. 
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}[The Tautological Bundle]{tautological-line-bundle}{6bb21c}
  Let $\Rp[n]$ be real projective space, the space of lines through the origin of
  $\R[n+1]$. Let $\tau = E \rmap{p} \Rp[n]$ be a line bundle where
  \[ E = \mkset{ \Par{\ell, v} \in \Rp[n] \times \R[n+1] }{ v \in \ell }, \] 
  where $p$ is given by the projection. This is called the \emph{tautological bundle} of
  $\Rp[n]$. The same construction may be done with $\Cp[n]$, too.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}[The Tangent Bundle]{tangent-bundle}{ebdea1}
  Given a smooth manifold $M^n$, we may form its tangent bundle $TM$, made up of the union of
  its tangent spaces $T_x M$ of vectors tangent to $x \in M$\footnote{A rigorous treatment of
  the tangent bundle is outside the scope of this book. See \citeme for further reading.}
  The rank of $TM$ is equal to the dimension of the manifold $M$.
\end{exmp}

As objects over $B$, vector bundles have the maps you'd expect:

\begin{defn}{vec-bun-maps}{e65fec}
  A map of bundles over $B$ $\ph: \xi \to \xi'$ consists of a ladder
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
    F \ar{d}{\ph_F} \ar{r}{} & E \ar{d}{\ph_E} \ar{r}{p} & B \\
    F' \ar{r}{} & E' \ar[']{ur}{p'}
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  where the map of fibers $\ph_F$ is also a linear map. If such a map
  is invertible, we say $\xi$ and $\xi'$ are isomorphic, and denote it
  in the usual way.
\end{defn}

Given another space $B'$, we can and a map from it, we can perform a
\emph{change of base}:
\begin{defn}{vec-bun-change-of-base}{21049c}
  Given a vector bundle $\xi = E \rmap{p} B$ and a map $f: B' \to B$, we may
  form their pullback:
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
    E \times[B] B' \ar{r}{} \ar{d}{} & \ar{d}{p} E \\
    B' \ar{r}{f} & B
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  The vector bundle given by the vertical arrow $E \times[B] B' \to B'$ is denoted
  by $f^*\xi$ and is called the \emph{pullback along $f$}.
\end{defn}

The following are easily verified:
\begin{prop}{simple-props-of-vec-bun-change-of-base}{3814b2}
  \hfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $B' \inj B$ is an inclusion, then $f^*\xi$ is isomorphic
          to the bundle given by restricting $p$ to to $B'$.
    \item For a sequence of bases $B'' \rmap{g} B' \rmap{f} B'$, there is
          a natural isomorphism
          \[ g^* f^* \xi \isom \Par{fg}^* \xi. \] 
  \end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Exercise. % TODO: link to exercise at the end of the section.
\end{proof}
